# AWS-Serverless-Data-Ingestion-Pipeline
This project implements a fully automated, event-driven data ingestion pipeline on AWS. It demonstrates a serverless architecture that generates synthetic stock market data, buffers it using a queue for decoupling, and ingests it into a NoSQL database for real-time storage.
